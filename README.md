Introduction # I am Narendra Kilari, from the southern part of India. I have 5 experience in the data analysis domain. In my previous project, I had faced some issues to handle, so I decided to enhance my skills, it’s led to pursuing my master’s in the USA.
I love Trekking and exploring new places which will help me to enrich myself.
I learned about the different styles in the git and how to pull and put the requests of the code while doing the projects.
